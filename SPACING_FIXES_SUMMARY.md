# Canvas Spacing Fixes - Mail Craft v1.6.0

## üéØ **SPACING ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **Problem Identified**
From the user's screenshot, there was excessive left padding/spacing in the canvas area, causing the email content (conditional layout blocks) to appear too far to the right and creating an unbalanced layout.

### **Root Causes Found & Fixed**

‚úÖ **Canvas Content Padding**
- **Issue**: Canvas container had `pl-12` (48px left padding) which was too excessive
- **Fix**: Changed to `p-3` (12px all around) for balanced spacing
- **Impact**: Content now properly centered with appropriate margins

‚úÖ **Block Control Positioning**
- **Issue**: Block controls positioned at `-left-12` were requiring excessive left padding to prevent overlap
- **Fix**: Adjusted to `-left-10` and added better styling with borders
- **Impact**: Reduced space requirements while maintaining functionality

‚úÖ **Row Control Positioning**  
- **Issue**: Row controls also positioned at `-left-12` contributing to spacing problems
- **Fix**: Updated to `-left-10` with improved styling
- **Impact**: Consistent positioning across all editing controls

‚úÖ **Container Padding Optimization**
- **Issue**: Canvas wrapper had `p-8` (32px) padding which was excessive for the available space
- **Fix**: Reduced to `p-4` (16px) for better space utilization
- **Impact**: More content area available while maintaining visual breathing room

## üé® **Visual Improvements Applied**

### **Spacing Hierarchy**
```css
/* Before (Excessive) */
.canvas-wrapper { padding: 32px; }
.canvas-content { padding-left: 48px; padding-right: 16px; padding-top: 16px; padding-bottom: 16px; }

/* After (Optimized) */
.canvas-wrapper { padding: 16px; }
.canvas-content { padding: 12px; }
```

### **Control Positioning**
```css
/* Before */
.block-controls { left: -48px; }
.row-controls { left: -48px; }

/* After */
.block-controls { left: -40px; border: 1px solid; border-radius: 4px; }
.row-controls { left: -40px; border: 1px solid; border-radius: 4px; }
```
