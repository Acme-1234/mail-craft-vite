  - **Basic**: Simple div with heading and paragraph
  - **Button**: Centered call-to-action button with inline styles
  - **Card**: Styled content card with border and background
- One-click template insertion at cursor position
- Email-optimized HTML with inline styles

### ✅ **Clean Interface Design**

## Technical Implementation

### **Components Created/Modified:**
- `src/components/editor/settings/HtmlSettings.tsx` - Main HTML editor component
- `src/components/editor/settings/types.ts` - Added HtmlSettingsProps interface
- `src/components/editor/settings/index.ts` - Exported HtmlSettings component
- `src/components/editor/SettingsPanel.tsx` - Added HTML block support

### **Dependencies Added:**

## Design Decisions

### **Simplified Approach:**
1. **HTML-Only Focus**: Removed CSS/JS tabs to focus on HTML editing
2. **No Preview Panel**: Canvas shows changes in real-time
3. **Essential Templates**: Limited to most common email patterns
4. **Clean UI**: Removed badges, complex toggles, and verbose warnings

### **Email Optimization:**
- Templates use inline styles for maximum email client compatibility
- Simple, tested HTML patterns that work across email clients
- Focus on email-safe HTML practices

## Testing
- ✅ Component builds successfully
- ✅ Monaco Editor loads and functions correctly
- ✅ Template insertion works properly
- ✅ Real-time canvas updates confirmed
- ✅ Integration with existing settings panel verified
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes

## Usage
1. Add an HTML block to the email
2. Select the block to open settings panel
3. Use Monaco Editor to edit HTML content
4. Insert templates using quick buttons
5. See changes immediately on the canvas

## Future Enhancements
